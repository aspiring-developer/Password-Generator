# PASSWORD GENERATOR:  3rd-Homework-SS
 * I started this homework by creating HTML, CSS and JS files.
 * I marked up HTML layout of the password generator page and applied css to it.
 * With a little knowledge gained from the class and by searching online, I started working on Javascript coding.
 * Having no experience making Javascript code that work, I started typing my codes by declaring variables first.
 * I declared variables that hold Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters.
 * I went further typing codes that I could produce without searching online or asking anyone. 
 **Real Chalange:**
 --- Variable declaration, confirm/promt window method, and getting DOM-element reference from HTML page to the Javascript page were the only things that I was confident with, so when for-loop, function and event-listener needed to add, I was clueless as what to do. I had no choice other than completing this homework in time, so Google came to my rescue!
 --- I searched how they exactly work with a real project like this homework; studied how the syntax is organised; tried to understand why the particular block of codes behaving this way and that way.
